-- Explanation: 
-- The first record in the table, like the last record, meets both of the two criteria.
-- The tiv_2015 value 10 is the same as the third and fourth records, and its location is unique.

-- The second record does not meet any of the two criteria. Its tiv_2015 is not like any 
-- other policyholders and its location is the same as the third record, which makes the third record fail, too.
-- So, the result is the sum of tiv_2016 of the first and last record, which is 45.
