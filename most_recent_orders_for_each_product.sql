Explanation: 
keyboard's most recent order is in 2020-08-01, it was ordered two times this day.
mouse's most recent order is in 2020-08-03, it was ordered only once this day.
screen's most recent order is in 2020-08-29, it was ordered only once this day.
The hard disk was never ordered and we do not include it in the result table.
